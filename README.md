# FlappyBirdClone
This is a program I made during High School that was submitted as my AP Computer Science Principles project. It is basedon the popular Flappy Bird Game and
utilizes the Java Swing library in order to display the animations within the program. It is quite simple, and doesn't support storing any sort of high score 
information. To run, simply launch the Flappybird.java file.
